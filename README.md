# [Hella featured devops container](https://github.com/adam-huganir/devops-container)
Ubuntu 23.04 based since this is not really intended to be stable 
from one version to the other, and we want the latest versions of software when possible

## Features:
- zsh and oh-my-zsh
- autocompletion for most tools that support it
- fzf
- LunarVim for IDE like experience on the go!
- terraform
- kubernetes utilities and some additional k8s tools that I like (kubectl, knative cli, istio cli, stern, kubetail, helm 3)
- jq/yq


## Notes:
Unsurprisingly this is a MASSIVE image, I will work on pruning down the size / build process
